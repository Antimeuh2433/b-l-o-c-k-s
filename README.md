# B-L-0-C-K-S

## Readme Notice
This readme file (much like the program) is a work in progress to make everything not cluttered. The previous readme file is available as README.md.old

## Description
B-L-0-C-K-S is a proof-of-concept / Educational Project inspired by tetris. It's built on SFML and CPP.
Everything is very much work in progress to say the least.

## Compile
Well there isn't much to compile right now, but you can try building the SFML libraries and intergrating the Main.cpp file located in src. The SFML build environment used is sfml-vscode-boilerplate. Documentation for that can be found at https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md.
