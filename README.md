# B-L-0-C-K-S

## Readme Notice
This readme file (much like the program) is a work in progress to make everything not cluttered. The previous readme file is available as README.md.old

## Description
B-L-0-C-K-S is a proof-of-concept / Educational Project inspired by tetris. It's built on SFML and CPP.
Everything is very much work in progress to say the least.

## Compile
### Mac and Linux
Coming soon!
### Windows
1. Install MinGW (SEH) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-7.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download
IMPORTANT! The version and the architecture is VERY important. It must be MinGW v.7.3.0 (SEH) 64-bit.

2. IMPORTANT! Add g++ to your PATH by adding C:\mingw64\bin (or wherever you extracted mingw) in the PATH environmental variable.

3. Run compile-install.windows.bat
